<h1> ABOUT ME!</h1>

<div>

<p> This website is all about me but it's also a huge shitpost! I made this website so people know more about me and they can know that I know how to make a website!
I'm 16 years old, male, proudly bisexual, my favorite color is easily any blue or green color mixed or not, my favorite food is mild chicken wings. I am a huge weeb
I love anime and manga I would read or watch it anyday, anytime. I also am obbssed with Android, IT, youtube, tiktok, twitter, dr. pepper and so on! I go to a top
prestige school in the United States of America in one state I won't expose for reasons as simple as this website would likely be easy to hack to find out
anyways, I get straight A's at school and there is so much more I could tell you about myself! You may learn more by scrolling through the website! Nice to
meet you hope we can be friends! </p>

<p> Here are my socials in case you maybe want to talk to me about anything! I'm a very
  friendly person and 95 percent of the time I'm not really thinking about myself when
  I can do something for others meaning any favors, questions, or anything like that
  I will do. I almost always have a great day and I'm pretty laid back and it's hard to make me mad unless you know me
  really well and know how to quickly agitate me. Fair warning if you do or say anything
  that is definately either rude in any context of who that person is, unmoral, unethic,
  to anyone I will do anything in my power to stop you from doing anything reguardless if
  it's considered unethical or not even if it gets me in trouble I'll do it. Remember,
  sometimes being a hero isn't the surface level understanding of saving the world. it's
  about protecting and spending time with the people and things you care about. For Whatever
  price it's worth I would do that. </p>
